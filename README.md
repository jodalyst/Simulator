# Simulator

Real basic, first pass at a numerical simualator built on an actual linear-algebra backbone (`numeric javascript found http://www.numericjs.com/index.php)

This demo just has a plotter of three states of a system. Goal is to evetually allow full simulation in here of arbitrarily high order systems.

Obviously this will never be as fast as a native environment simulation, but this might be good enough for web-based learning and other things.
